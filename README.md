**Installation of BackBox Linux OS**

Installation and configuration of BackBox Linux in a virtualized environment for penetration testing and system programming exploration.

**system call**

The unlink system call in BackBox Linux (and other Unix-like systems) is used to delete a file by removing its directory entry, effectively reducing its link count. If the link count reaches zero and no processes are using the file, the system frees the file’s disk space. It’s commonly used in scripts or programs to manage files directly through system-level commands.
